This is a project to rebuild Christine Love's "Fuck the Super Game Boy" articles as a single ebook in ePUB and PDF formats.
See the original articles [here](https://blog.loveconquersallgames.com/post/2350461718/fuck-the-super-game-boy-introduction).

I'm using [Sigil](https://sigil-ebook.com/) to build a new ePUB structure and import the original HTML from the Tumblr posts.
If you clone the repo or just download the .epub file, you can examine it with Sigil too, or just unpack it with an archive manager like a .zip file.
The ePUB file in this repo is built using version 2 of the ePUB standard.

I do have Love's permission to do this, per [this Bluesky post](https://bsky.app/profile/christinelove.bsky.social/post/3lfvv5y3mr223).
