This is a project to rebuild Christine Love's "Fuck the Super Game Boy"
articles as a single ebook in ePUB and PDF formats. See here:

Right now I'm just hand-editing everything and manually recreating an ePUB
structure with the new book text.

I do have Love's permission to do this, per a Bluesky post:

There are copyrighted books in this repo and I apologize to the book authors; they'll be removed later. They are here to serve as ePUB structure and formatting references for myself.
