Her works cover a wide range of stories, from action-packed adventures to thoughtful epistolary tragedies. Her most recent game is the road trip adventure Get in the Car, Loser!, and her previous erotic romantic comedy Ladykiller in a Bind won the IGF 2017 award for Excellence in Narrative. In her spare time, she protects the solar system from danger as a interstellar fighter pilot, and her love for you is powerful enough to save all of space. Yes, thatâ€™s her real name.</p>
